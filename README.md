## Setting up Ghostscript
For conversion, we use Ghostscript, however, Cloud Functions doesnâ€™t come with Ghostscript installed so we have to add it to our project ourselves, as a git submodule:

```git submodule add --name lambda-ghostscript -- https://github.com/sina-masnadi/lambda-ghostscript.git functions/lambda-ghostscript```

Doing this will add the directory of the submodule and create a file called .gitmodules that is used to version control your submodules. For more details on how the .gitmodules file is used in a team setting see the documentation provided by git.
